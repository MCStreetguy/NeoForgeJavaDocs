**Please note:** the provided docs may be outdated and partially incomplete.  
No guarantee is given for their correctness and completeness in any case!

This is especially true for versions that are not marked as "stable".
These are based on beta releases from NeoForge and can change anytime a new
version is released! However, all versions marked as "stable" are based on
stable releases, are therefore final and normally wont change anymore.
